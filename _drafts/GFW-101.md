In order to visit a website, you open your favorite web browser, type in a URL, and hit enter. This seems pretty straightforward, until you  realize that your computer doesn’t actually know how to reach  “google.com”. Instead, your computer needs an IP address before it can  make its request. To solve this issue, your computer sends the domain to a DNS (**D**omain **N**ame **S**ystem) server which then returns the IP address of the web server. From there, your computer can then send a request to the IP address, and the  website you visited loads.

But, there’s a pretty big design flaw: requests and responses to/from a DNS  server aren’t encrypted. This means that your ISP, or anyone with access to your network, can at the very least see the websites you’re  visiting, and at worst modify the responses (and direct your browser to  visit a different website than the one you intended without you or your  browser knowing). Not that there’s any reason for your ISP to do this,  as your default DNS server(s) are probably theirs in the first place.

Luckily, this isn’t as much of a problem as figuring out where to send  the data in terms of security and privacy. Most websites you’ll be  visiting use something called HTTPS, which is probably most commonly  recognized via the green (or gray in some cases) padlock icon that  appears next to the address bar of your browser. This ensures that not  only your session is being encrypted, but also that you’re communicating with the correct web server. In the event that you’re not communicating with the correct server, and you’re using HTTPS and not plain HTTP,  your browser will let you know that something is wrong with a big, scary red warning. Of course, this isn’t a guarantee as there is a small  chance someone can steal the HTTPS certificate of the website they’re  impersonating. Additionally, HTTPS only verifies that the certificate  matching the domain name you visited, not the one you intended; this  means that if you’re redirected to a site with the domain  “www.apple.com.example.net,” that site can still have a valid HTTPS  certificate despite impersonating Apple. However, for the most part, if  you typed in the correct URL, you can be sure you’re browsing the  website you intended.



Luckily, a solution to the DNS problem now exists in the form of [DNS over HTTPS, also known as DoH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS). Basically, this protocol simply sends your DNS queries through an HTTPS connection instead of over the open internet as-is. This ensures that  your DNS queries are not being monitored by a third party and that the  DNS response has not been tampered with.

However, there are still some problems with this approach. For one, you still  need to have faith in your DNS provider because they can still see the  websites you’re requesting along with information such as your IP  address, which can then technically be sold to others. Additionally,  your ISP and others on your network can still know which websites you’re visiting by inspecting your web traffic*. Even without knowing the  domain you’re actually visiting, anyone on your network can still see  the IP address of the website you’re visiting, which may be combined  with reverse DNS to figure out which website you’re visiting.

* The ClientHello packet sent when initiating an HTTPS connection includes the site you want to connect with. This allows for multiple HTTPS-enabled websites to be hosted on the same IP address. Without this, it would be impossible for the web server to know which certificate to send to establish the HTTPS connection, as that is reliant on the site's domain. The process can be better understood in the image below.It is worth noting that it is now possible to encrypt this data in TLS 1.3 via encrypted SNI, but it does not appear to be enabled by default in the latest version of Google Chrome (as of December 4, 2019). You can check if your browser supports encrypted SNI here.

Diffie-Hallman: **You're not \*sharing information\* during the key exchange, you're \*creating a key\* together.**

This is particularly useful because you can use this technique to create an encryption key with someone, and then start encrypting your traffic with that key. And even if the traffic is recorded and later analyzed, there's absolutely no way to figure out what the key was, even though the exchanges that created it may have been visible. This is where [perfect forward secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy) comes from. Nobody analyzing the traffic at a later date can break in because the key was never saved, never transmitted, and never made visible anywhere.





A **trapdoor function** is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) that is easy to compute in one direction, yet difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding its [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function)) without special information, called the "trapdoor". Trapdoor functions are widely used in [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography).
