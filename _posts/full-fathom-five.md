## Lyrics

Song: Méav Mhaolchatha
Lyrics: W.Shakespeare

Full fathom five thy father lies
你的父亲沉睡于五英寻深的海水之中
Of his bones are coral made
他的骨化作珊瑚
Those are pearls that were his eyes
他的眼化为珍珠
Full fathom five thy father lies
你的父亲沉睡于五英寻深的海水之中
Of his bones are coral made
他的骨化作珊瑚
Those are pearls that were his eyes
他的眼化为珍珠
Nothing of him that doth fade
他并未消逝
But doth suffer a sea-change
但伴随着海的变迁
Into something rich and strange
他幻化为陌生之物
rich and strange
多彩而奇异
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
海妖摇响他的丧钟
Hark, now I hear 'em
听，现在我听见了
Ding-dong
叮咚…
