## Hakuna Matata

This list of videos provides me just right amount of nihilism, reminding me that life is ultimately meaningless in the first place. I always find myself at peace and being able to function after watching them. I am able to remember my temporary first priority of life: to fulfill my curiosity.

This is my Hakuna Matata, or Hasa Diga Eebowai if you like :)

## Articles

One of my favorite blog, [Wait but why](https://waitbutwhy.com/), has focused on human related topics.

> After a year and a half of writing Wait But Why posts, I’ve noticed a theme: humans seem to come up a lot.
>
> Sometimes we talk about where humans [came from](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/your-ancestor-is-jellyfish.html) or where we [might](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) be going or how we’re all [related](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/your-family-past-present-and-future.html); other times we look at how we [interact](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/the-great-perils-of-social-interaction.html) [and](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/07/7-ways-to-be-insufferable-on-facebook.html) [communicate](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/11-awkward-things-about-email.html) and [form](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html) [relationships](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html). We’ve talked about [rich](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/03/combined-wealth-world.html) humans and [famous](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/absurdly-famous-people-probably-dont-know-enough.html) humans and [baby](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/how-to-name-baby.html) humans and [dead](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/08/the-death-toll-comparison-breakdown.html) humans and [humans](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/20-things-i-learned-while-i-was-in.html) [from](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/07/russia-what-you-didnt-know.html) [all](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/07/japan-and-how-i-failed-to-figure-it-out.html) [over](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/08/19-things-learned-nigeria.html) [the](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html) [world](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/but-what-about-greenland.html). We’ve explored what it means [to be a human](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html), what it means to be a [good human](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html), and whether we’re [all alone](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html) in the universe. And we’ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out [what](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html) [really](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) [matters](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html) [most](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html) in this [one, short human life](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).
